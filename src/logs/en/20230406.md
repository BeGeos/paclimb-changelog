# Added auth and sign up for beta testers

**Improvements**

- Expose session to the browser for client-side requests
- Add `AsyncStorage` to optimise crag data loading and displaying on main map view. When preview card is shown we use temporary memory to save network bandwidth and increase response time
- Reduced server latency for async requests

**Features**

- Authentication and sign up for beta testers only
- App is now closed to non registered users
- Redirect logic after sign-in/up

**Bugs**

- Network requests get rejected (401) for `missing token` &rarr; (fixed)
