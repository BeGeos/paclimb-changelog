# PaClimb Change Log

The changelog is updated everytime a new deployment is issued for the main branch.

Deployments are not automatic and they will encompass multiple changes and fixes and they will be included under the date of the deployment. Inside they will destructure a hisory of changes and merges (take from Github and the new `changelog.md` in the PaClimb App)
